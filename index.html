            <h2>The Lore of Jojo da Bojo</h2>
            <p>Jojo da Bojo is a rare Bojo. But he was not always a bojo... Legends say he was born under a full moon, a sign that he was the Trader Zhou. Trader Zhou‘s number one customer was Ved. And Ved, liked to draw smiley faces. Lots and lots of smiley faces. One day he drew so many smiley faces That he had a vision. In this vision he saw that Trader Zhou must be a Bojo. JoJo da Bojo!
Ved knew that all Bojos must be sacrificed in the mouth of the great volcano. When JoJo da Bojo learned of this evil plot he knew what must be done. He said to Ved, Ved Vod Ved Vod. This infuriated Ved distracted him but he grew accustomed to it, used to it and remembered his true focus. But one day Senis came by, breathing heavily(as he’d had just ran 5 ft) and with every breath came a noise, “Veed Veed” and as Jojo da Bojo was saying “Ved Vod Ved Vod” Senis breathed “Veed Veed” and in perfect harmony they realized what happened. “Ved vod ved vod Veed Veed” “Ved vod ved vod Veed Veed” “VED VOD VED VOD VEED VEED”
And with that Ved could not take it anymore he forsake the world for this curse and ran into hiding.</p>
